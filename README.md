## Presentation
<p>
As a tribute to the renowned digital artist Freider Nake, this project revisits his work Labyrinth, adding nuances of frequencies and colours chosen in a procedural way, but while respecting the rules set by the artist in his work. A perfect opportunity to immerse yourself in the beginnings of digital art. This project was created with Processing 3.
</p>
<p>
This project is an initiative resulting from a lecture about algorithmic aesthetics at the IMAC engineering school.
</p>

Realized in December 2018.
